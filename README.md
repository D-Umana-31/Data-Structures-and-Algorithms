What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The projects for this course required designing and implementing a course advising system that allows users to load course data from a file, print a sorted list of courses, and retrieve details about specific courses, including prerequisites. The problem revolved around understanding and applying the appropriate data structures to handle hierarchical relationships and efficiently store and search data.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To approach this problem I first began by analyzing the requirments and breaking down the asks into smaller more managable steps. Then I chose the data struture that would be most efficient. Then I started sesigning modular code. Data structures are important because they provide the foundation for organizing data in ways that align with the problem's requirements, such as enabling quick access, sorting, or insertion.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

A roadblock that I encountered was when I coded my menu. At first it was doing an endless loop, but with some debugging and rewriting, I was able to code the menu to display as intended. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on the project help to build my understanding and apperciation for planning before coding, using modular development, and balancing performance and usability. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project helped to grow my understanding and skills of writing clear, self-documenting code with descriptive variable and function names and adding comments throughout the code to help others understand the logic I was using. It also helped me build my skills in breaking down large functions into smaller, single-purpose functions improved code readability and reduced complexity.
